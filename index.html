	I have not discussed the HTML, CSS, or JavaScript language code 
	in my program with anyone other than my instructor or the teaching 
	assistants assigned to this course.

	I have not used HTML, CSS, or JavaScript language code obtained 
	from another student, or any other unauthorized source, either 
	modified or unmodified.

	If any HTML, CSS, or JavaScript language code or documentation 
	used in my program was obtained from another source, such as a 
	textbook or website, that has been clearly noted with a proper 
	citation in the comments of my program.
