	I have not discussed the HTML, CSS, or JavaScript language code 
	in my program with anyone other than my instructor or the teaching 
	assistants assigned to this course.

	I have not used HTML, CSS, or JavaScript language code obtained 
	from another student, or any other unauthorized source, either 
	modified or unmodified.

	If any HTML, CSS, or JavaScript language code or documentation 
	used in my program was obtained from another source, such as a 
	textbook or website, that has been clearly noted with a proper 
	citation in the comments of my program.

            <p> Everyone calls me by that nickname. It started when my little brother pronounce my name as "Kitten," and just went on from that.
                Now, my friends and family also call me any variation of Kitty, like Kitkat, Kits, Kitto, ...   </p>

            <h1> What do I do? </h1>
            <p> Well, for one, I spent my entire Saturday making this website pretty... HAHAHA! I'm an illustrator and UXUI designer, which is probably
                why I couldn't submit a sub-par html (but hey, I enjoyed). I actually used to hate art, especially when I was forced to enroll in summer
                classes for painting. Now, I think design and art have been embedded deep in my veins. </p>
